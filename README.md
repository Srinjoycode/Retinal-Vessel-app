# Retinal-Vessel-app
Diabetes is the deadliest disease in the world, and often it goes undiagnosed due to lack of testing centers or non-awareness of its symptoms.An extremely common complication of diabetes on the human body is diabetes induced retionopathy . For the detection of  retionopathy accurate eye vessel measurements are needed . This problem can be easily solved with supervised computer vision using deep learning , however no easy to use user interfaces exists for this task to be done without heavy technical knowledge of computer science. So an easy to use interface through which the fundus(retinal) blood vessels can be segmented out is required in today's health industry for faster detection and treatment of diabetic retinopathy.
